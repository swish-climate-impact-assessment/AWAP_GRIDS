AWAP GRIDS

The aim of this script is to download the spatial grids of the Australian Water Availability Project http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/, and experiment with extracting time-series for arbitrary pixels based on place-name or BoM station number (and compare the pixels to the stations).  

Working with raw grids was assessed first but was considered less desirable than loading these to a PostGIS database server, which is what the code does now.

WARNING
Beware that the daily gridded dataset is sizable and you may get a lot of data downloaded in a short amount of time!
