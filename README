The aim of the script is to download the spatial grids of the Australian Water Availability Project http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/, and I want to get a time-series for arbitrary pixels based on place-name or BoM station number (and compare the pixels to the stations).  

WARNING
Beware that the daily gridded dataset is sizable and you may get a lot of data downloaded in a short amount of time!
